    <h2>Article - #1</h2>
    <p>
      Since the <strong>Apollo missions</strong> when 12 astronauts first set foot on the Moon, no human has returned to its surface. However, <strong>NASA</strong> now intends to change that through the <strong>Artemis Program</strong>. Unlike Apollo, Artemis doesn’t only intend to reach the Moon, but also aims to build a sustainable, long-term human presence by developing <strong>advanced space habitats</strong>, utilizing lunar resources, and preparing humanity for future <strong>Mars missions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Space habitats</strong> are specially designed living environments that allow astronauts to survive and work in the harsh, anti-living conditions of space. Unlike spacecraft, habitats are built for long-term missions and include self-sustaining <strong>life support systems</strong> that provide essentials like air, water, and temperature control.
    </p>
    <p>
      A proper space habitat should be able to protect astronauts from radiation, maintain health and hygiene, support mental well-being, and enable exploration and research. To achieve these goals, space habitats integrate many essential systems, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide Removal System</strong> – Removes CO₂ from the air, as even small buildups can be toxic to the crew.</li>
      <li><strong>Condensing Heat Exchanger</strong> – Balances humidity and temperature inside the habitat, preventing condensation that could damage equipment.</li>
      <li><strong>EVA Computer</strong> – Supports Extra-Vehicular Activities (spacewalks), monitoring suit oxygen levels, time, and communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Oxygen Generator</strong> – Uses water electrolysis to provide a continuous supply of breathable oxygen for the crew.</li>
      <li><strong>Suitport</strong> – A modern replacement for traditional airlocks. It allows astronauts to dock their suits directly to the habitat exterior, preventing lunar or Martian dust from entering.</li>
      <li><strong>Urine & Water Processors</strong> – Recycle urine and wastewater into clean drinking water, minimizing dependence on Earth resupply.</li>
      <li><strong>Radiation Shielding</strong> – Protects from harmful cosmic and solar radiation using thick walls, water layers, or advanced materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Power System</strong> – Provides reliable energy (solar, battery, or nuclear) for life support and scientific operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Crew Psychological Support</strong> – Offers private spaces, family communication, VR experiences, and entertainment to reduce isolation stress.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Through the combination of these systems, <strong>Artemis</strong> aims not just to visit the Moon—but to make it humanity’s first sustainable outpost beyond Earth. These efforts will serve as the foundation for future deep space missions, including the first human journey to <strong>Mars</strong>.

    <p><b>Matthew A. Simon, Dr Alan W. Wilhite,</b> <i>A Tool for Automated Design and Evaluation of Habitat Interior Layouts, AIAA, 2013.</i> This paper gave us a science-based approach, a complete list of evaluation criteria, on how to evaluate Moon/Mars habitat designs quantitatively and qualitatively. This information was incorporated in the game specifying key constraints to evaluate and determining how to evaluate them. This input was entered in the form of data to an AI API which generates feedback that is visualized to the user further in the game, informing users what to improve and how to do so. Also, it helped in designing of 3D models incorporated into the game making it perfect for utilizing space and assessing crew needs.</p>

    <p><b>Callie Burke, Robert L. Howard Jr, Paul Kessler,</b> <i>Internal Layout Assessment of a Lunar Surface Habitat, NASA Space Center, 2022.</i> This paper informed us about a perfect example of a habitat implementation on the Moon. It enumerates volume and area requirements for each habitat function (such as sleep, hygiene, recreation) and lays out a three-level architecture with ladder systems and overlapping systems. It helped us design realistic size 3D models with intricate internal architecture.</p>

    <p><b>Erika L. Wagner,</b> <i>Deep Space Habitability Design Guidelines (NASA TP-2020-220505), NASA Johnson Space Center, 2020.</i> This paper provided astronaut-validated habitability design guidelines derived from test prototypes for deep space missions. It outlined important habitat capabilities, minimum dimensional requirements, and rules for separating hygiene-demanding and waste-producing functions. We incorporated these insights into our project by using them to set realistic constraints and further improve internal layout and feedback system.</p>

    <p><b>Society, P.,</b> <i>Mars, the Red Planet, The Planetary Society, 2025.</i> 
    <a href="https://www.planetary.org/worlds/mars" target="_blank">https://www.planetary.org/worlds/mars</a>  
    This source provided us with key environmental data about Mars, including its thin CO₂-rich atmosphere (95%), low gravity (38% of Earth), long day length, and harsh environmental conditions. This helped us to set realistic constraints and guide players to take into consideration pressurization, insulation, and life-support resources when creating habitats on Mars.</p>

    <p><b>Society, P.,</b> <i>The Moon: Gateway for Science and Exploration, The Planetary Society, 2025.</i> 
    <a href="https://www.planetary.org/worlds/the-moon" target="_blank">https://www.planetary.org/worlds/the-moon</a>  
    This source provided us with essential background about the Moon as a site for early habitats, highlighting terrain features that affect habitat placement. This helped us design realistic 3D terrain and plan habitat implementation in the Moon’s environment, making our game both realistic and educational.</p>

    <p><b>George C. Marshall,</b> <i>Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), Marshall Space Flight Center, 2017.</i> This paper covers critical systems such as oxygen generation, carbon dioxide removal, air filtration, and water recovery aboard space habitats. By incorporating these principles into our game, we can require players to install life-support devices to simulate realistic conditions.</p>

    <p><b>Sanders, M. G., & Sanders, M. G.,</b> <i>3D Resources – NASA Science, NASA Science, 2025.</i> 
    <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/" target="_blank">https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/</a>  
    This source provided us with helpful examples of 3D models that inspired us to create in-game models. Also, 3D models from the website were imported and further modified to fit our in-game experience.</p>
